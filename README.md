# terrible-logos

Generate bad logos by switching font for each letter of a given text. A configuration panel allows to edit text, intervals, and enable colorful background.

This is a simple experimentation with the BEM methodology, also used as a tutorial.

## Install

```
npm install
bower install
```

To launch:
```
gulp
```

**WarningÂ :** You'll need *gulp 4.0*. If you don't have it installed on your system, you can use the local one:
```
node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js
```

Or you can launch the distributed version `dist/index.html` after using the gulp task `dist`.

But at this point, you'll probably be wondering if you really need it.
